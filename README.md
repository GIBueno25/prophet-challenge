# **MODULE 8 CHALLENGE**

## **Mercado Libre**
The purpose of this assignment is to identify patterns in Google searches for Mercado Libre, the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America and any relationships between search traffic and stock prices.

This challenge requires students to read data into a DataFrame, mine the search data for seasonality, relate search traffic to stock prices, and create a time series model using Prophet. Resulting plots revelated trends and patterns such as what hours of the day, days of the week and times of the year search traffic was at its highest and lowest. It also revealed if there were relationships between between the lagged search traffic and the stock volatility or between the lagged search traffic and the stock price returns.
